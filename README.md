# HoltekLib

**HoltekLib** is a collection of lightweight and practical libraries for Holtek 8-bit microcontrollers. These libraries are written in C and use assembly registers as specified in the Holtek datasheets, designed for embedded applications. The goal of this collection is to provide low-volume, high-efficiency libraries.

## Features

- **GPIO Support**: Control of general-purpose input and output.
- **Interrupts**: Management and setup of external and internal interrupts.
- **USART**: Serial communication with support for data transmission and reception.
- **Timers**: Configuration and use of internal microcontroller timers.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Designed for low-volume, resource-constrained applications.
- **Compatibility with Holtek 8-bit Microcontrollers**: Optimized for the specific architecture of these microcontrollers.

## Installation and Usage

To use the HoltekLib libraries, simply include the relevant files in your project and use the provided functions. All libraries are designed to be usable with minimal initial setup.
