# HoltekLib

**HoltekLib** is a comprehensive collection of lightweight and practical libraries for Holtek 8-bit microcontrollers. These libraries are written in C and utilize assembly registers as specified in the Holtek datasheets, specifically designed for embedded applications. The goal of this collection is to provide low-volume, high-efficiency libraries.

## Features

- **GPIO Support**: Control of general-purpose input and output.
- **RCC Management**: Control of Reset and Clock functions for power management and watchdog timer functionality.
- **ADC Functionality**: Read analog signals through Analog-to-Digital Conversion.
- **USART**: Serial communication with support for Hardware UART for data transmission and reception.
- **EEPROM Support**: Access and manage EEPROM for non-volatile storage.
- **Timers**: 
  - **Base Timers and BTimer**: Configuration and use of Base Timers 0 & 1, along with functions for basic timer operations.
  - **Standard Type TM**: Support for Standard Type Timer operations.
  - **Periodic TM Operation**: Functionality for periodic timer tasks.
- **NTC Support**: Integration with NTC thermistors for temperature sensing.
- **Display Control**: Manage 7-segment displays for numerical output.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Designed for low-volume, resource-constrained applications.
- **Compatibility with Holtek 8-bit Microcontrollers**: Optimized for the specific architecture of these microcontrollers.
