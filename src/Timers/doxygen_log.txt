You can use Doxygen in a number of ways:

1) Use Doxygen to generate a template configuration file*:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen [-s] -g [configName]

2) Use Doxygen to update an old configuration file*:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen [-s] -u [configName]

3) Use Doxygen to generate documentation using an existing configuration file*:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen [configName]

4) Use Doxygen to generate a template file controlling the layout of the
   generated documentation:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -l [layoutFileName]

    In case layoutFileName is omitted DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as filename.
    If - is used for layoutFileName Doxygen will write to standard output.

5) Use Doxygen to generate a template style sheet file for RTF, HTML or Latex.
    RTF:        /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -w rtf styleSheetFile
    HTML:       /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -w html headerFile footerFile styleSheetFile [configFile]
    LaTeX:      /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -w latex headerFile footerFile styleSheetFile [configFile]

6) Use Doxygen to generate a rtf extensions file
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -e rtf extensionsFile

    If - is used for extensionsFile Doxygen will write to standard output.

7) Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template configuration file
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -x [configFile]

   Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template configuration file
   without replacing the environment variables or CMake type replacement variables
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

8) Use Doxygen to show a list of built-in emojis.
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -f emoji outputFileName

    If - is used for outputFileName Doxygen will write to standard output.

*) If -s is specified the comments of the configuration items in the config file will be omitted.
   If configName is omitted 'Doxyfile' will be used as a default.
   If - is used for configFile Doxygen will write / read the configuration to /from standard output / input.

If -q is used for a Doxygen documentation run, Doxygen will see this as if QUIET=YES has been set.

-v print version string, -V print extended version information
-h,-? prints usage help information
/Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -d prints additional usage flags for debugging purposes
